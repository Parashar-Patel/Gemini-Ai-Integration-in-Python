# Gemini-Ai-Integration-in-Python
This Python script demonstrates the integration of the Gemini AI model for generating conversational responses based on user input. The script utilizes the google.generativeai library to configure and interact with the Gemini model, and pyttsx3 for text-to-speech conversion, enhancing the user experience by vocalizing responses.You may change it accordingly. as per your reference and you may also read in markdown file (.md).

## **The key features of the script include**

* ***Model Configuration*** : The Gemini AI model is configured with specific parameters such as temperature, top_p, top_k, and maximum output tokens to control the response generation.

* ***Chat Session Initialization*** : The script initializes a chat session with a predefined history of interactions, ensuring that the model understands the context and can generate appropriate responses.

* ***Conversation Management*** : User inputs and AI responses are stored in a JSON file to maintain a history of conversations. Additionally, conversations are appended to a Markdown file for easy readability and reference.

* ***Text-to-Speech Conversion*** : The pyttsx3 library is used to convert the AI's responses into speech, providing an audible response to the user.

* ***Interactive Loop*** : The script runs an interactive loop, allowing continuous user input and generating responses until the user decides to exit.

Overall, this script showcases a robust approach to integrating advanced AI models into Python applications, leveraging both text and speech capabilities to create a dynamic and user-friendly interaction.


# implementation:

This project demonstrates how to integrate the Gemini AI model into a Python application to generate conversational responses based on user input. The project also includes text-to-speech capabilities for an enhanced user experience.

## Requirements

1. Python 3.6 or higher
2. `google.generativeai` library
3. `pyttsx3` library

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Parashar-Patel/Gemini-Ai-Integration-in-Python.git
   cd gemini-ai-integration

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv

3. **Create a virtual environment**:
   
   **On Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ``` 
   **On macOS and Linux**:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   
4. **Install the required libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r
   ```

## **Configuration**
1. Add your API key in the code: Locate the line in the main.py file where the API key is specified:

  ```python
  genai.configure(api_key="your-api-key-here")
  ```
  Replace "your-api-key-here" with your actual Google API key.

## Usage
1. **Run the script**:

  ```bash
  python main.py
  ```

2. **Interact with the Gemini AI**:

    *  The script will prompt you to enter your input.

    *  Type your message and press Enter.
  
    *  The AI will respond and also vocalize the response.
  


## **Extra UseCase (For Student)**:
  I made one Specialized .json file contact me to get this it will help you for exam purpose it has some default added prompt by me.In futurr it may not be available then do it fast take it from me by contacting me on my e-mail : patelparashar33@gmail.com This can only be useful to solve question in such a way that you can understand and can get marks as well.
